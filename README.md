**[Release] [YMAP] County Upgrade.**

---

The County Upgrade is an upgrade of the whole Blaine County area which adds around 750+ new props to the area. It was hand built in Codewalker with many props placed by hand, and then moved correctly into position. This YMAP is simple, clean and look’s very natural for the area. It’s a massive upgrade over the base visuals.
